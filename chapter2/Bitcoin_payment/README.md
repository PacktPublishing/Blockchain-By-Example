**issue 1**: More than one instance of bitcore-lib found. Please make sure to require bitcore-lib and check that submodules do not also include their own bitcore-lib dependency.


**Solution** : edit node_modules/bitcore-payment-protocol/node_modules/bitcore-lib/index.js


```bitcore.versionGuard = function(version) {
  /*if (version !== undefined) {
    var message = 'More than one instance of bitcore-lib found. ' + 
      'Please make sure to require bitcore-lib and check that submodules do' +
      ' not also include their own bitcore-lib dependency.';
    throw new Error(message);
  }*/
};```
